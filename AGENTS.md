# AGENTS.md

Entry point for AI agents working in this repo. Start with `CONTEXT.md` for the
project's domain and vocabulary; this file records how the engineering skills
are wired up here.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live as local markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical roles, default strings, recorded as a `Status:` line in each issue file. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
